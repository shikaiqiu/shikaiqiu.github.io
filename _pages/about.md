I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), working with [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/). I aim to understand how to efficiently build models capable of achieving strong generalization. I have worked on probabilistic methods, transfer learning, and the connection between physics and ML. You can reach me at [sq2129@nyu.edu](mailto:sq2129@nyu.edu).

In Dec 2021, I received my bachelor's degree in Physics and Computer Science from UC Berkeley. There, I worked with [Jennifer Listgarten](http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com/), [Haichen Wang](https://hwang43.web.cern.ch/) and [Ben Nachman](https://nachmangroup.github.io/) on the use of equivariant deep learning models to tackle problems in high energy physics and biochemistry. 

In the summer of 2022, I worked on modeling protein structures as a research intern at Meta AI's protein team, led by [Alex Rives](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vqb78-gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Tom Sercu](https://tom.sercu.me/). Currently, in the summer of 2023, I'm working with [Boran Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Prwxh24AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Danielle Robinson](https://dcmaddix.github.io/) at Amazon AWS, pushing the boundaries of transfer learning in an era rich with foundation models.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
