I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), working with [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/). I want to understand how to build models capable of achieving strong generalization. I'm currently interested in Bayesian methods, function space modeling, symmetries, and equivariance. You can reach me at [sq2129@nyu.edu](sq2129@nyu.edu).

In Dec 2021, I received my bachelor's degree in Physics and Computer Science from UC Berkeley, where I was grateful to have worked with [Jennifer Listgarten](http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com/) and [Haichen Wang](https://hwang43.web.cern.ch/) on using equivariant deep learning models to tackle problems in high energy physics and biochemistry. 

In summer 2022, I worked on modeling protein structures as a research intern at Meta AI's protein team led by [Alex Rives](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vqb78-gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Tom Sercu](https://tom.sercu.me/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
