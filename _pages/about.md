I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), working with [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/). I'm interested in the science of scaling neural networks. You can reach me at [sq2129@nyu.edu]().

I'm supported by the Two Sigma PhD Fellowship. Previously, I was a Student Researcher at Google Research with [Nikunj Saunshi](https://www.nikunjsaunshi.com/) and [Elan Rosenfeld](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~elan/) (2025), working on looped transformers for LLM reasoning, and at Google DeepMind with [Jeffrey Pennington](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cn_FoswAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Atish Agarwala](https://ati.sh/bio/) (2024), where our work on [scaling collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02119) received an ICML Oral. I also interned at Amazon AWS (2023) and Meta AI (2022).

I studied Physics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where I worked with [Jennifer Listgarten](http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com/) on equivariant neural networks for drug discovery, and [Haichen Wang](https://hwang43.web.cern.ch/) and [Ben Nachman](https://nachmangroup.github.io/) on deep learning for high energy physics and search for physics beyond the Standard Model via the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN, which received the [2025 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics](https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/1/L3993). 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
